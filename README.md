👋 Hi, I’m @kavyasudhakollu

👀 I’m interested in data engineering, real-time data processing, and cloud computing. 
    I love working with big data and finding innovative solutions to optimize data workflows.
    
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced AWS services, machine learning models, and data visualization techniques. 
    I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and stay updated with the latest industry trends.
    
💼 Currently, I'm a Software Engineer - Data at CDS Global, where I lead the migration of projects from Pentaho to AWS and Python, enhance batch processing with Kafka
    and Kinesis, and develop comprehensive reports and dashboards using QuickSight.
    
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source data engineering projects, Python libraries, and cloud-based applications.
    I enjoy sharing knowledge and working with diverse teams to create impactful solutions.
